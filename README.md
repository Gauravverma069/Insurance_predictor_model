# Insurance_predictor_model
Insurance Prediction Application using Linear regression model and deployment in cloud.

## Overview
This application is a simple implementation of linear regression deployed in the cloud. The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how linear regression can be used to predict a target variable based on one or more input features.

## Features
Linear Regression Model: The core functionality of this application is powered by a linear regression model. This model is trained on a dataset with Age,height,weight,no of children etc.

Streamlit User Interface: The application utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive user interface. Users can input their data through widgets and view predictions instantly.

Cloud Deployment: The application is deployed in the cloud, making it accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Deployment
This application is deployed in the cloud "HuggingFace" using [hugging_face_deployed_model]([https://www.provider.com](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gaurav069/Acko_insurance_app)).

## Dependencies
The application relies on the following dependencies:

Python
Streamlit (for building the interactive user interface)
Joblib (for model persistence)
Scikit-learn (for implementing the linear regression model)
